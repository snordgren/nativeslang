# nativeslang

The first website I ever wrote and designed. It's intended to give language learners a
place to give each other feedback on texts written in their target language.

The backend was written using Java, Spark Java (the web micro-framework), HSQLDB, and
j2html. If I had started this project today, I would not have used this stack.

While the backend isn't so impressive, I'm happy with the design.

## Download and run
Clone the git repository and use `gradle run` to start the server.

    $ git clone https://github.com/snordgren/nativeslang.git
    $ cd nativeslang
    $ gradle run
    
This will start the server on port 8080. Open your favorite web browser and visit `localhost:8080` to browse your local version of the site. The CSS supports mobile screens, try resizing your browser to test different resolutions.
